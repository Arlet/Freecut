Freecut v0.1

Free firmware replacement for Cricut Personal paper cutter.

***********************************************************************************
* IMPORTANT: REPROGRAMMING THE AVR WILL PERMANENTLY ERASE YOUR ORIGINAL FIRMWARE  *
***********************************************************************************

!!! THERE IS NO WAY TO GET THE ORIGINAL FIRMWARE BACK !!!

Firmware cannot be copied from another machine (it has been locked and cannot be
read from the CPU)

Firmware cannot be restored through any PC application used for normal
firmware upgrades.

This firmware has only been tested on the machine that I have. It may
not work on your machine.  It may cause permanent damage, and it will
certainly void your warranty.

If you still want to proceed:

Attach an AVR programming cable to cartridge connector on the main board (J5):

 J5   |  AVR
------+-----
  1   |  PDO
  3   |  SCK
  4   |  PDI
  5   |  RESET
  6   |  GND

Top view of connector:

       J5
+----        ---+
| 9  7  5  3  1 |
|10  8  6  4  2 |
+---------------+


===edge of board======

After reprogramming, the machine should beep, and display "Freecut v0.1" on the LCD display.

Use the USB cable to communicate (keypad is mostly non-functional, as well as the 3 dials on the front).

USB uses 115200 baud, 8N1.

Following commands are available:

version
move <x> <y>		
draw <x> <y>
curve <x0> <y0> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> <x3> <y3>
speed <num>
press <num>
flash 

All coordinates integer step numbers (~400 steps/inch)

speed - lower numbers are faster. 40 is about the fastest practical speed. 100 is reasonable for most cases. 
press - lower numbers are more pressure. 1023 is minimum, 0 is maximum.
flash - just dumps the internal AT45DB041 flash chip in CAR mode.

Don't send too many commands too quickly. Wait for '>' prompt before sending another line.

NOTE: This is the first quick & dirty version. User interface may experience
sudden changes (like a more sensible speed/press syntax)
