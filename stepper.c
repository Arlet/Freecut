/*
 * stepper.c
 *
 * Driver for stepper motors. Each motor is a 6-wire unipolar model. Each of
 * the 4 coils (per motor) can be driven with a full current (through the big
 * transistor) or a reduced current (through a smaller transistor + 47 Ohm
 * resistor). The reduced current I call 'half current', but it may be less.
 * 
 * The Y motor (pen movement) is controlled through PORTC, and the X motor
 * (mat roller) is controlled through PORTA. Connections are identical.
 * 
 * In addition, the Z coordinate is controlled by two pins: PE2 is used
 * for up/down toggle, and PB6 selects the pressure with a PWM signal.
 * 
 * A small pushbutton is attached to PD1, which is active low when
 * pushed. This button detects when the gray cover on the pen holder is
 * moved all the way to the 'home' position.
 * 
 * Step resolution is about 400 steps/inch. For a 6x12 inch mat, that means
 * there's about 2400x4800 steps of usable space. Coordinate origin is the
 * blade starting point on the mat. A small amount of negative X is allowed
 * to roll the mat out of the machine.
